# Identified the following issues:
#' - no NAs, likely coded as something else, found NAs to be coded as "" AKA empty string
#' - dates are coded as character not as numeric or POSIX
#' - factor-able variables are stored as strings (state, country, etc.)

####MV COMMENTS: Overall, you did a thorough job at identifying and making changes to ensure the structure and quality of the data was accurate.
#### I like your use of functions to speed up the process and packages like dplyr, great job!!
#### My only note is to check the as.POSIXct function on line 104, as you did not specify an origin which is a necessary argument (i.e.  origin = "1960-01-01"),
#### and you did not call the variable correctly, you did duration.seconds but you needed data1$duration.second to call the variable
